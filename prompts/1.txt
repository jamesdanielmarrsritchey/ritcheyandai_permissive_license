jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Is this license missing anything common to other open source licenses? Provide examples, but don't copy text from other licenses.

GitHub Copilot: The provided license covers many of the common elements found in open source licenses, but there are a few areas that are often addressed in other open source licenses that are not explicitly covered here:

1. **Patent Grant**: Many open source licenses include a clause that grants users a license to any patents that cover the work. This helps to protect users from patent infringement claims.

2. **Contribution**: Some licenses address the issue of contributions made by others to the work. They may specify how contributions are licensed and whether contributors grant the same permissions to their contributions as are granted for the original work.

3. **Termination**: Many licenses include a clause that specifies the conditions under which the license can be terminated. For example, the license may automatically terminate if a user sues someone over patent infringement related to the work.

4. **State Changes**: Some licenses require that changes to the work be tracked. This could be in the form of a changelog or simply requiring that modified files carry a notice stating they have been changed.

5. **No Endorsement**: Some licenses include a clause that prohibits the use of the licensor's name to promote derived products without specific permission.

6. **Jurisdiction and Dispute Resolution**: Some licenses specify the jurisdiction for any disputes and the method of dispute resolution (e.g., arbitration).

Remember, this is not legal advice, and you should consult with a legal professional when drafting a license.

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Write an example of a no endorsement statement. Do not copy text from other licenses.

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's an example of a "No Endorsement" clause:

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: What are some concerns with this license text?

GitHub Copilot: While the license text covers many important aspects, there are a few potential concerns or areas that could be clarified:

1. **Patent Grant**: The license does not mention anything about patent rights. Many open source licenses include a clause that grants users a license to any patents that cover the work. This helps to protect users from patent infringement claims.

2. **Contribution**: The license does not address the issue of contributions made by others to the work. It may be beneficial to specify how contributions are licensed and whether contributors grant the same permissions to their contributions as are granted for the original work.

3. **Termination**: The license does not specify the conditions under which the license can be terminated. For example, the license may automatically terminate if a user sues someone over patent infringement related to the work.

4. **State Changes**: The license does not require that changes to the work be tracked. This could be in the form of a changelog or simply requiring that modified files carry a notice stating they have been changed.

5. **Jurisdiction and Dispute Resolution**: The license does not specify the jurisdiction for any disputes and the method of dispute resolution (e.g., arbitration).

6. **No Endorsement Clause**: The "No Endorsement" clause is included under "Conditions", but it might be clearer if it had its own section.

Remember, this is not legal advice, and you should consult with a legal professional when drafting a license.
