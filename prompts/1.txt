jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Which features do open source licenses usually have? Provide examples, but don't copy from existing licenses.

GitHub Copilot: Open source licenses usually have the following features:

1. **Free Redistribution**: The license does not restrict anyone from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources.

    Example: You can distribute the software in your own product, whether it's free or commercial.

2. **Source Code**: The license must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form.

    Example: The software can be distributed in both its original source code form and in a compiled, executable form.

3. **Derived Works**: The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.

    Example: You can modify the software, create your own works based on it, and distribute those works under the same license.

4. **Integrity of The Author's Source Code**: The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time.

    Example: If you modify the source code, you may need to also provide the original source code, or a mechanism to obtain it.

5. **No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups**: The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.

    Example: The license cannot prevent certain people or groups from using the software.

6. **No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor**: The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor.

    Example: The license cannot prevent the software from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.

7. **Distribution of License**: The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.

    Example: The rights provided by the license are automatically available to anyone who receives a copy of the software.

8. **License Must Not Be Specific to a Product**: The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution.

    Example: If the software is extracted from a distribution and used separately, all the rights still apply.

9. **License Must Not Restrict Other Software**: The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software.

    Example: The license cannot insist that all other software distributed on the same medium must also be open source.

10. **License Must Be Technology-Neutral**: No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.

    Example: The license cannot require that the software be run on specific hardware, or with a specific type of interface.

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Combine these examples into a single example.

GitHub Copilot: Here's a combined example that incorporates all the features mentioned above:

> This is the "Sample Open Source License". You are free to copy, modify, and distribute this software, in both source code and binary form. You can also create and distribute works that are based on it, under the same license.
> 
> If you distribute this software in a modified form, you must also provide the original source code, or a mechanism to obtain it, such as a link to the original source code repository. You can distribute this software as part of your own product, whether it's free or commercial.
> 
> This license does not discriminate against any person, group, or field of endeavor. Anyone who receives a copy of this software automatically receives the rights provided by this license. These rights apply even if the software is not part of a specific software distribution, and even if the software is used separately from any other software.
> 
> This license does not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with this software. It does not require that all other software distributed on the same medium be open source. It also does not require that the software be run on specific hardware, or with a specific type of interface. This license is technology-neutral.
> 
> By using this software, you agree to the terms of this license. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use this software.

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Without copying from existing licenses, write an example of a disclaimer statement.

GitHub Copilot: Here's an example of a disclaimer statement:

> "This software is provided 'as is', without any express or implied warranty. In no event will the authors or distributors be held liable for any damages arising from the use of this software. This includes, but is not limited to, any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages, any loss of data, or any loss of profits, even if the authors or distributors have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Your use of this software signifies your acceptance of this disclaimer."

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Add this example into the full license example.

GitHub Copilot: Here's the full license example with the disclaimer statement added:

> This is the "Sample Open Source License". You are free to copy, modify, and distribute this software, in both source code and binary form. You can also create and distribute works that are based on it, under the same license.
> 
> If you distribute this software in a modified form, you must also provide the original source code, or a mechanism to obtain it, such as a link to the original source code repository. You can distribute this software as part of your own product, whether it's free or commercial.

> 
> By using this software, you agree to the terms of this license and accept this disclaimer. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use this software.

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Don't use the word "software". Use language that can refer to software, documentation, media, or anything else someone might want to open source.

GitHub Copilot: Here's the revised license example:

> This is the "Sample Open Source License". You are free to copy, modify, and distribute this work, in both source and compiled form. You can also create and distribute works that are based on it, under the same license.

> 
> By using this work, you agree to the terms of this license and accept this disclaimer. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use this work.

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Add section titles

GitHub Copilot: Here's the revised license example with section titles:

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: In the permissions section, clarify that "under the same license" doesn't mean a new work needs to be under this license, only the borrowed parts need to be.

GitHub Copilot: Here's the revised "Permissions" section with the requested clarification:

> **Permissions**: You are free to copy, modify, and distribute this work, in both source and compiled form. You can also create and distribute works that are based on it. However, any portions of the new work that are borrowed from this work must be distributed under the same license. The new work as a whole can be under a different license.

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Add this suggestion to the whole license.

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: In the definitions section, define "source", define "compiled form", define "distribute", define "modify". These definitions should be in the context of open source works. Do not copy definitions from existing licenses.

> ### Legal Text
> - **Source**: The original, human-readable code that a programmer writes before it is compiled or run through an interpreter. In the context of open source works, this refers to the version of the work that is publicly available for viewing and modification.
> - **Compiled Form**: The machine-readable, executable form of a program that has been translated from source code by a compiler. In the context of open source works, this refers to the version of the work that is ready for execution but not typically suitable for modification.
> - **Distribute**: The act of making a work available to others. In the context of open source works, this can include actions such as sharing the work online, including the work in a software package, or providing the work on a physical medium.
> - **Modify**: The act of making changes to a work. In the context of open source works, this can include actions such as altering the source code, adding new features, or fixing bugs.

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Is it missing any common open source license aspects?

GitHub Copilot: Your license covers most of the common aspects found in open source licenses. However, there are a few optional aspects that some open source licenses include:

1. **Patent Grant**: Some licenses include a clause that grants users a license to any patents that cover the software. This is to prevent the situation where the software is open source, but users are still legally unable to use it due to patent restrictions.

2. **Contribution**: Some licenses include a clause that outlines how others can contribute to the project. This can include things like the requirement to grant the project a license to use your contribution.

3. **Termination**: Some licenses include a clause that specifies the conditions under which the license can be terminated. This is usually when the user fails to comply with the terms of the license.

4. **State Changes**: Some licenses require that changes made to the code be documented. This is to ensure that users of the software can easily see what changes have been made in versions of the software they receive.

Please note that these are optional and whether you include them depends on the specific needs of your project.

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Without copying from existing licenses, provide example statements for these, but don't incorporate them into the full license text. Just show them separately for now.

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here are example statements for each of these aspects:

1. **Patent Grant**:
   "The licensor hereby grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license under patent claims of the licensor that are necessarily infringed by the software provided by the licensor. This patent license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the software as provided by the licensor."

2. **Contribution**:
   "If you contribute to the software or make modifications, you hereby grant the licensor a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license to use, reproduce, distribute, perform, and display your contributions, in any form and for any purpose."

3. **Termination**:
   "Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice from the licensor if you fail to comply with any of its terms. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the software and destroy all copies, full or partial, that you have made of the software."

4. **State Changes**:
   "If you modify the software, you must include a file detailing the changes made. This includes the date of any change and the reason for the change. This is to ensure that recipients of the software can identify the changes made to the software."

Remember, these are just examples and should be tailored to fit the specific needs of your project.
